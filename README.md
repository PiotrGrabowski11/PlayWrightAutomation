README
This repository contains my initial experiments using Playwright for test automation.

Introduction
Playwright is a powerful open-source framework for automating web browsers. It provides a unified API to interact with multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. With Playwright, you can write tests in various programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C#. This repository focuses on using Playwright for test automation and includes some basic examples to get started.

Installation
To run the tests in this repository, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
